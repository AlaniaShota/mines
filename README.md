# Mines Game

Mines is a simple and engaging web-based game inspired by classic Minesweeper mechanics. Built with TypeScript, Vite, and Vanilla JavaScript, the game allows users to place a bet, reveal safe tiles, avoid hidden mines, and cash out their winnings based on dynamically calculated multipliers.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```
run the project:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
and you are all set!

## Technical decisions

~ Vite + Vanilla TypeScript – Fast build tool with TypeScript support. Easy to set up and ideal for small projects. Helped improve development speed and code safety.

~ HTML + CSS – Used to create the layout and style of the game. The design is simple, clean, and responsive.

~ OOP – The project uses classes like Game, Grid, and Tile. This makes the code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.

~ These are some improvements I would add if I had more time:

I plan to add smooth animations using GSAP. This will make the game feel more dynamic and interactive.

I would like to save the last few games using localStorage, so the player can see their recent results. 

I want to improve the code structure by fully typing all classes and UI elements. This will help avoid bugs, make the project easier to read, and improve development in the long run.
